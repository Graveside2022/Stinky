Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to activities related to the technical use
of the software, including:

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[CONTACT_EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

For security-related violations or illegal activity reports, please use our
security reporting process outlined in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
