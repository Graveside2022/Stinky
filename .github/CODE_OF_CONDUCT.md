## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community
leaders responsible for enforcement at [CONTACT_EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any
incident.

For security-related violations or illegal activity reports, please use our security reporting
process outlined in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
