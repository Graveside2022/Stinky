# Offline Tiles Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Installed GDAL Tools**
   - Installed `gdal-bin` and `python3-gdal` packages for tile generation

2. **Generated Offline Tiles**
   - Created placeholder world map image
   - Georeferenced the image using GDAL
   - Generated 1,365 map tiles across zoom levels 0-5
   - Tiles stored at: `/home/pi/projects/stinkster_malone/stinkster/data/offline-tiles/tiles/`
   - Total size: ~5.7MB

3. **Server Configuration**
   - Server already configured to serve tiles at `/offline-tiles/*`
   - Verified tiles are accessible (e.g., http://localhost:8002/offline-tiles/0/0/0.png)

4. **Client Integration**
   - Created `cesium-offline-config.js` module for offline tile management
   - Updated both `index.html` and `index_mobile_optimized.html` to:
     - Include the offline configuration script
     - Check for offline tiles availability
     - Prioritize offline tiles when available
     - Fall back to online providers when offline tiles unavailable

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created `test-offline-tiles.html` for testing offline functionality
   - Includes toggle between online/offline tiles
   - Tile URL verification

6. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive setup guide at `docs/OFFLINE_TILES_SETUP.md`
   - Created tile download script for better imagery

## How to Use

1. **Access the main application**: http://localhost:8002
   - The Cesium globe will automatically use offline tiles if available

2. **Test offline tiles**: http://localhost:8002/test-offline-tiles.html
   - Verify offline tiles are loading
   - Toggle between online and offline imagery

3. **Download better tiles** (optional):
   ```bash
   cd /home/pi/projects/stinkster_malone/stinkster/data/offline-tiles
   ./download-better-tiles.sh
   ```

## Benefits

- **Offline Operation**: Globe works without internet connection
- **Fast Loading**: Local tiles load much faster than remote imagery
- **Reduced Bandwidth**: No need to download tiles repeatedly
- **Field Ready**: Perfect for operations in areas with limited connectivity

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Download higher quality imagery when internet is available
2. Create region-specific tile sets for detailed offline maps
3. Add UI controls to switch between tile sets
4. Implement tile caching for hybrid online/offline operation
