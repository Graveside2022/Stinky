# Script Execution Test Report

Generated: 2025-06-15

## Summary

Tested script execution paths after the project reorganization to ensure all scripts can still be executed properly.

## Test Results

### 1. Shell Script Syntax Tests

All key shell scripts passed syntax validation:

| Script | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `dev/tools/component-manager.sh` | ✓ Pass | Syntax valid, paths correct |
| `dev/components/gpsmav.sh` | ✓ Pass | Syntax valid, uses relative paths |
| `src/orchestration/gps_kismet_wigle.sh` | ✓ Pass | Syntax valid, uses STINKSTER_ROOT |
| `dev/tools/health-check.sh` | ✓ Pass | Syntax valid |

### 2. Path Reference Fixes

Fixed incorrect path references in orchestration scripts:

| File | Issue | Fix Applied |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `src/orchestration/v2gps_kismet_wigle.sh` | Referenced `/scripts/start_kismet.sh` | Changed to `/src/scripts/start_kismet.sh` |
| `src/orchestration/gps_kismet_wigle_fast_simple.sh` | Referenced `/scripts/start_kismet.sh` | Changed to `/src/scripts/start_kismet.sh` |

### 3. Relative Path Verification

Verified that scripts use proper relative path calculation:

- **Component Manager**: Uses `PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)"`
- **Dev Components**: All use proper relative paths to find project root
- **Main Orchestration**: Uses `STINKSTER_ROOT` environment variable with fallback

### 4. Script Execution Tests

| Command | Result | Output |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `./dev.sh help` | ✓ Success | Shows help menu correctly |
| `./dev/tools/component-manager.sh list` | ✓ Success | Lists all components |
| Python path test | ✓ Success | Python can import from standard paths |

### 5. Symlink Integrity

Root-level symlinks to external directories are intact:
- `gpsmav -> /home/pi/gpsmav/`
- `hackrf -> /home/pi/HackRF/`
- `kismet_ops -> /home/pi/kismet_ops/`
- `openwebrx -> /home/pi/openwebrx/`
- `scripts -> /home/pi/Scripts/`
- `stinky -> /home/pi/stinky/`
- `wigletotak -> /home/pi/WigletoTAK/`

### 6. Python Script Verification

- Python scripts have proper shebang lines (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
- Import statements work correctly
- Virtual environment activation in dev scripts is functional

### 7. Service Scripts

- Systemd install script uses proper relative paths
- Service files reference correct locations

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Orchestration Script Paths**: Two orchestration scripts had hardcoded references to `/scripts/` instead of `/src/scripts/`. These have been fixed.

2. **No Major Breaking Changes**: All other scripts maintained their functionality after reorganization.

## Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Consider standardizing on `STINKSTER_ROOT` environment variable across all scripts for consistency.

2. **Path Validation**: Add path existence checks in critical scripts before execution.

3. **Documentation**: Update any documentation that references old script locations.

## Conclusion

Script execution paths have been successfully verified and fixed where necessary. All major scripts are functional after the reorganization. The development environment remains fully operational with proper path references throughout the codebase.
