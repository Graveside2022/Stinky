# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of Stinkster:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Model

The Stinkster platform operates in a distributed environment with multiple components handling sensitive data including:

- **RF spectrum data** from SDR devices
- **WiFi network information** from monitoring operations
- **GPS location data** from tracking systems
- **Network traffic metadata** from packet analysis
- **System configuration** and credentials

### Trust Boundaries

1. **Hardware Interface Layer**: Direct hardware access (HackRF, GPS, WiFi adapters)
2. **System Service Layer**: System-level services and daemons
3. **Application Layer**: Python applications and web services
4. **Network Interface Layer**: External network communications
5. **User Interface Layer**: Web dashboards and control interfaces

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage and Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: Within 90 days of initial report

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels based on CVSS 3.1 scoring:

**Critical (9.0-10.0)**
- Complete system compromise
- Unauthorized RF transmission capability
- Mass data exfiltration of location/network data

**High (7.0-8.9)**
- Privilege escalation to root/admin
- Authentication bypass in web interfaces
- Unauthorized access to sensitive RF data

**Medium (4.0-6.9)**
- Limited data disclosure
- Denial of service attacks
- Configuration manipulation

**Low (0.1-3.9)**
- Information disclosure with minimal impact
- Local-only vulnerabilities requiring physical access

## Security Considerations by Component

### HackRF/SDR Security

**Potential Risks:**
- Unauthorized RF transmission
- Spectrum pollution or interference
- Eavesdropping on sensitive communications
- Hardware device exploitation

**Mitigation:**
- Input validation for all frequency and gain parameters
- Power level limiting and regulatory compliance
- Secure hardware communication protocols
- Regular firmware updates

### WiFi Monitoring Security

**Potential Risks:**
- Unauthorized network access attempts
- Privacy violations through packet capture
- Legal compliance violations
- Network disruption or jamming

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor mode only (no transmission)
- Data anonymization and retention limits
- Access control for captured data
- Compliance with local privacy laws

### GPS/Location Security

**Potential Risks:**
- Location privacy violations
- GPS spoofing or jamming
- Unauthorized tracking capabilities
- Data correlation with other sources

**Mitigation:**
- Optional GPS functionality
- Location data encryption
- Configurable data retention policies
- User consent mechanisms

### Web Interface Security

**Potential Risks:**
- Authentication bypass
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection (if databases used)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

**Mitigation:**
- Strong authentication mechanisms
- Input sanitization and validation
- HTTPS/TLS encryption
- CSRF protection tokens
- Content Security Policy headers

### Docker/Container Security

**Potential Risks:**
- Container escape vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation
- Insecure container configurations
- Supply chain attacks on base images

**Mitigation:**
- Regular base image updates
- Non-root container execution
- Resource limits and isolation
- Security scanning of images

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Access Control:**
   - Change default passwords immediately
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication where available
   - Limit network access to essential systems

2. **Network Security:**
   - Use VPN for remote access
