### Next Steps for Full Waterfall Display
To see the waterfall in OpenWebRX web interface:
1. Open http://your-pi-ip:8073 in a web browser
2. Login with credentials: admin/hackrf
3. Select a profile (FM Broadcast, 2m, 70cm, or Airband)
4. The waterfall should start displaying once a profile is selected

### Troubleshooting Tips
If waterfall doesn't display in web interface:
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
3. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
4. Try a different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

### Conclusion
The HackRF is functioning correctly and actively receiving signals. The hardware, drivers, and basic signal processing are all working as expected.
