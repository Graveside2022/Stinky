### Final State:
- Last action completed: Created comprehensive TODO.md with session summary
- Dependencies status: All system and Python dependencies documented and managed
- Tests status: Configuration validation tools created, integration testing pending
- Next required action: Execute final integration testing using install.sh
- Parallel tasks completed: Configuration system, Docker setup, documentation, service management

### Session Summary:
This session focused on creating a robust configuration and orchestration system for the stinkster project. The main achievements include:

1. **Configuration Management**: Implemented a template-based system for managing all component configurations
2. **Docker Integration**: Set up OpenWebRX with proper HackRF integration and container management
3. **Service Orchestration**: Created systemd services and orchestration scripts for coordinated startup
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation covering setup, configuration, and troubleshooting
5. **Automation**: Installation and setup scripts for streamlined deployment

The system is now ready for final integration testing and validation before production deployment.

### Next Session Priorities:
1. **Integration Testing**: Run complete system test using install.sh
2. **Service Validation**: Test all service orchestration and data flow
3. **Production Preparation**: Finalize deployment configuration and security

### Environment State:
- Virtual environment: Not applicable (configuration project)
- Dependencies installed: System dependencies documented, Python requirements managed per component
- Services running: Configuration phase complete, ready for testing phase

### Progress in last period:
- [x] Completed full project backup (2025-06-15_v1) with comprehensive documentation
- [x] Analyzed project structure and identified sensitive configuration files
- [x] Prepared GitHub sanitization strategy for public repository
- [x] Identified docker-compose.yml and load_config.sh as requiring sanitization

### Currently working on:
- GitHub preparation phase - sanitizing sensitive configuration data
- Preparing project for public repository while maintaining functionality
- Creating secure template system for sensitive configurations

### Next immediate steps:
1. **File Sanitization (PRIORITY)**:
   - [ ] Sanitize docker-compose.yml - remove sensitive paths and credentials
   - [ ] Sanitize load_config.sh - remove hardcoded paths and personal data
   - [ ] Review all template files for any remaining sensitive data
   - [ ] Create .gitignore to protect local configurations

2. **GitHub Preparation**:
   - [ ] Create sanitized configuration examples
   - [ ] Update documentation with generic setup instructions
   - [ ] Test installation process with sanitized configurations
   - [ ] Prepare repository for public release

### Current Session Context:
- Working from /home/pi/projects/stinkster/ directory
- Full backup created: docker-backup/2025-06-15_v1/ 
- User Christian connected via SSH from Mac
- Project ready for GitHub preparation and sanitization
- All original configurations preserved in backup
