NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES:
=======================
1. Continue development work on specific features
2. Implement any remaining dependency optimizations
3. Complete integration testing across all components
4. Deploy configuration changes to production environment

SESSION ACHIEVEMENTS:
====================
✓ Complete project documentation overhaul
✓ Dependency analysis and management system
✓ Configuration templating and organization
✓ Security audit and cleanup recommendations
✓ Development environment standardization
✓ Backup and recovery procedures established
✓ Path migration to new project structure
✓ Component mapping and architecture documentation

BACKUP VERIFICATION:
===================
- Total files backed up: 80+ files across multiple categories
- Documentation: Complete and cross-referenced
