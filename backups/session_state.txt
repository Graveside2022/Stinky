Project: Stinkster SDR System

CURRENT SESSION PROGRESS:
- Session started: 2025-06-14T23:34:00Z (approx)
- Primary objective: Prepare project for GitHub publication
- Main backup completed: 2025-06-15_v1 (Success)

COMPLETED ACTIONS:
1. ✓ Created comprehensive project backup (2025-06-15_v1)
2. ✓ Documented all files and structure
3. ✓ Identified security-sensitive files requiring sanitization
4. ✓ Preserved original hardcoded configurations in backup
5. ✓ Verified backup integrity (104MB compressed, 729MB total)

CURRENT PROJECT STATE:
- Working directory: /home/pi/projects/stinkster
- Git status: NOT a git repository (planned for initialization)
- Configuration status: Contains hardcoded credentials (needs sanitization)
- Docker status: OpenWebRX backup available (109MB tar.gz)
- Security files: Identified and documented for template conversion

FILES REQUIRING ATTENTION:
- docker-compose.yml (hardcoded password: hackrf)
- load_config.sh (hardcoded IP: 10.42.0.1)
- *.json config files (contain real credentials)
- systemd service files (may contain paths/credentials)

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. Sanitize hardcoded credentials in configuration files
2. Convert sensitive configs to template format
3. Create .env.example with dummy values
4. Initialize git repository
5. Create .gitignore for sensitive files
6. Push sanitized version to GitHub

BACKUP INTEGRITY VERIFICATION:
- Backup location: /home/pi/projects/stinkster/backups/2025-06-15_v1/

- Critical files preserved: All configuration, scripts, documentation
- Docker archives: Included (openwebrx-hackrf-working.tar.gz - 109MB)
- Metadata recorded: backup_info.txt with complete details

RECOVERY INFORMATION:
- Full restore possible from 2025-06-15_v1 backup
- All original credentials preserved in backup
- Project can be fully reconstructed from backup if needed
- Backup excludes only: .git/, __pycache__/, *.pyc, node_modules/

SESSION HANDOFF READINESS:
- All work documented and backed up
- Next session can safely continue with sanitization
- Backup verified and accessible
