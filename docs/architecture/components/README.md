## Overview

Level 3 component diagrams provide detailed architectural views of critical system components, showing internal structure, data flow, and integration patterns at the implementation level.

## Critical Components

### Core Processing Components
- [Spectrum Analyzer Component](./spectrum-analyzer.md) - Real-time FFT processing and visualization
- [Kismet Integration Component](./kismet-integration.md) - WiFi scanning and data capture
- [GPS Bridge Component](./gps-bridge.md) - MAVLink to GPSD conversion
- [WigleToTAK Converter](./wigletotak-converter.md) - WiFi data to TAK message conversion

### Infrastructure Components  
- [Service Orchestration](./service-orchestration.md) - Process lifecycle management
- [Configuration Management](./configuration-management.md) - Template-based configuration system
- [Web Application Framework](./web-framework.md) - Multi-service web interface
- [Docker Integration](./docker-integration.md) - Containerized service management

### Integration Components
- [Data Pipeline](./data-pipeline.md) - Real-time data flow coordination
- [API Gateway](./api-gateway.md) - Unified API access layer
- [Event Bus](./event-bus.md) - Inter-component communication
- [Monitoring & Alerting](./monitoring.md) - System health and performance tracking

## Component Categories

### Data Processing
Components responsible for acquiring, processing, and transforming raw data from hardware sources.

### Web Services
Components providing web-based interfaces, APIs, and real-time communication capabilities.

### Integration Services
Components managing communication between subsystems and external systems.

### Infrastructure Services
Components providing foundational capabilities like configuration, monitoring, and orchestration.

## Component Interaction Patterns

### Publisher-Subscriber Pattern
Many components use event-driven communication for loose coupling and scalability.

### Request-Response Pattern
Web services and APIs use synchronous request-response for immediate feedback.

### Pipeline Pattern
Data processing components use pipeline architecture for stream processing.

### Observer Pattern
Monitoring and alerting components observe system state changes.

## Implementation Standards

### Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Dependency injection where appropriate
- Interface-based design for testability
- Configuration-driven behavior

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Comprehensive logging
- Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Performance Optimization
- Asynchronous processing for I/O operations
- Connection pooling for network resources
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Resource monitoring and alerting

### Security Implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure credential management
- Encrypted communication channels
- Audit logging for security events
