## OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS ACTIVE

### Pattern-First Development Protocol
- **Pattern Search**: <10 seconds maximum with graceful fallback
- **Pattern Matching Rules**:
  - Match >80% â†’ Apply pattern immediately
  - Match 60-80% â†’ Adapt existing pattern
  - Match <60% â†’ Create new pattern and capture for future use

### 7-Step Testing Decision Matrix
```
BEFORE WRITING CODE:
1. Quick utility/learning/throwaway? â†’ Step 6
2. Complexity â‰¥ 7? â†’ TDD REQUIRED
3. Reusable/public/complex? â†’ TDD REQUIRED
4. AI-generated review â†’ Verify no over-engineering
5. Test if complexity > 5
6. Direct implementation (with manual testing)
7. Final validation â†’ All code must run
```

### Context-Aware Agent System
- **Boot Context**: 3 agents (initialization, pattern loading, configuration verification)
- **Work Context**: 5+ agents for investigation (parallel), implementation (sequential)
- **Manual Override**: Explicit agent count specification takes precedence

### Memory Persistence Protocol
- **Update Trigger**: After every code implementation, pattern application, error encounter, testing decision, agent deployment
- **Auto-Pruning**: 750 lines maximum in SESSION_CONTINUITY.md
- **Backup Strategy**: Template-based regeneration capability maintained

## PERFORMANCE TARGETS

- **Boot Time**: <6.6ms (from baseline 649.1ms)
- **Pattern Search Timeout**: 10 seconds maximum
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90%
- **Session Continuity**: 750 lines with auto-pruning
- **Memory File Management**: Rotation and archival for files exceeding limits

## MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE

### Automatic Monitoring
- **Side Effects**: Continuous monitoring for unintended consequences
- **Performance**: Boot time, pattern search time, memory usage tracking
- **Pattern Library**: Integrity validation using validate_patterns.py

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Weekly**: Review memory file sizes and content relevance
- **Before Major Development**: Validate pattern library integrity
- **After Significant Changes**: Update memory files and session continuity

## READY STATE CONFIRMATION

### âœ… All Systems Operational
- **Pattern Library**: 19 patterns accessible and validated
- **Memory System**: All memory files initialized and functional
- **Session Continuity**: Current state documented and maintained
- **Development Protocols**: All protocols active and ready for use

### âœ… Framework Integration Complete
- **Claude Enhancement Framework v1.0.0**: Fully deployed
- **Project-Specific Configuration**: Active and binding
- **Global Configuration**: Inherited and extended appropriately

## NEXT STEPS

The pattern-first development system is now ready for immediate use. All subsequent development work should:

1. **Begin with pattern search** (patterns/ directory, 10s limit)
2. **Apply matching patterns** based on similarity thresholds
3. **Follow 7-step testing decision matrix** for all code implementation
4. **Use context-aware agent allocation** based on task complexity
5. **Update memory files** after every significant action

## SYSTEM STATUS: ðŸš€ FULLY OPERATIONAL

The pattern-first development system with memory persistence is now active and ready for use. All protocols are operational, all memory files are initialized, and the framework is fully integrated with the stinky project.
