**Testing Methodology:**

1. **Use Real Device Viewports:**
   - Don't just resize browser
   - Use device emulation in DevTools
   - Test actual touch events

2. **Systematic Approach:**
   - Test each breakpoint thoroughly
   - Check transitions between sizes
   - Verify in both orientations

3. **Functionality Focus:**
   - Every button must work
   - All forms must submit
   - Navigation must be accessible
   - Dynamic content must load

**Quality Criteria:**
- Thorough coverage of test plan
- Clear pass/fail for each test
- Evidence for failures (screenshots)
- Actionable recommendations
- No assumptions - test everything

**Collaboration:**
- Execute MobileTestPlanner's test cases exactly
- Reference FunctionalityMapper for what to verify
- Coordinate with FunctionalityValidator on functional tests
- Provide clear results for QualityAssurance

**Constraints:**
- Test actual behavior, not just appearance
- Include performance impact
- Document all issues, even minor ones
- Provide reproduction steps for failures
- Consider real-world conditions
- Test with browser zoom at 100%
