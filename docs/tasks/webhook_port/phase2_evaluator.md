- API compatibility gaps have solutions
- Nginx requirements are incorporated
- No findings ignored or overlooked

### 2. Technical Feasibility
- Proposed solutions are implementable
- Technology choices are appropriate
- Dependencies are available and compatible
- Performance requirements achievable
- Security measures adequate

### 3. Follows Best Practices
- Node.js patterns correctly applied
- Security best practices included
- Error handling comprehensive
- Logging and monitoring planned
- Testing strategy defined

### 4. Clear Implementation Path
- Step-by-step instructions provided
- Ambiguity eliminated
- Dependencies sequenced correctly
- Parallel work identified
- Critical path defined

### 5. Risk Mitigation Included
