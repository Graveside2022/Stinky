## TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Fixed Test Failures

#### 1. calculateBandwidth Function
**Issue**: Logic error in bandwidth calculation at -3dB points  
**Fix**: Updated algorithm to properly find left/right bounds and include peak point  
**Result**: Test now passes, accurate bandwidth estimation restored

#### 2. Validator Schema Integration  
**Issue**: Joi schema validation throwing type errors  
**Fix**: Restructured validator module with proper Joi integration and error handling  
**Result**: All validation tests passing, robust error reporting

#### 3. sanitizeMAC Function  
**Issue**: Function not preserving original delimiter format and incorrect invalid MAC handling  
**Fix**: Updated logic to preserve format for valid MACs, proper fallback for invalid inputs  
**Result**: Test expectations met, maintains backward compatibility

### Quality Assurance Infrastructure

#### Created New Test Files:
- `quality-assurance-validation.js` - Automated QA validation script
- `tests/integration/services.test.js` - Service integration tests  
- `tests/performance/load-test.js` - Comprehensive load testing suite
- `QUALITY_ASSURANCE_REPORT.md` - Detailed QA findings and recommendations
