# Client IP Detection Fix Summary

## Problem
The Express application was not correctly detecting client IP addresses when accessed through a reverse proxy or with forwarded headers. The webhook rate limiter was using `req.connection.remoteAddress` which doesn't respect proxy headers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enable Trust Proxy in Express
Added to `server.js` line 411:
```javascript
app.set('trust proxy', true);
```

This enables Express to trust the `X-Forwarded-For` and other proxy headers when determining the client IP via `req.ip`.

### 2. Fix Webhook Rate Limiter
Updated `lib/webhook/index.js` line 85-91 to use proper IP detection:
```javascript
const clientId = req.ip || 
               req.headers['x-forwarded-for']?.split(',')[0].trim() || 
               req.headers['x-real-ip'] || 
               req.socket?.remoteAddress || 
               'unknown';
```

### 3. Fix Morgan Logging
Updated `server.js` line 425-427 to override the remote-addr token:
```javascript
morgan.token('remote-addr', (req) => {
    return req.ip || req.headers['x-forwarded-for'] || req.headers['x-real-ip'] || req.socket.remoteAddress;
});
```

### 4. Debug Endpoint
Added `/api/debug/ip` endpoint at line 1920 for testing IP detection.

## Testing
Created test script `test-client-ip.js` that verifies:
- The debug endpoint correctly identifies forwarded IPs
- The webhook endpoints receive the correct client IP
- Rate limiting uses the real client IP, not the proxy IP

## Result
- `req.ip` now correctly returns the real client IP when proxy headers are present
- Rate limiting works based on actual client IPs, not proxy IPs
- Morgan logs show the real client IP addresses
- The application properly handles both direct connections and proxied connections
