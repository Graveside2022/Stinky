# System Resource Exhaustion Analysis Report

## Investigation Date: 2025-06-19 11:13

### Executive Summary
After thorough investigation, **NO EVIDENCE** of resource exhaustion was found that would trigger SIGTERM signals. The system has ample resources available across all critical metrics.

### System Resource Status

#### 1. Memory Analysis
- **Total Memory**: 7.6 GB
- **Available Memory**: 6.0 GB (78.8% available)
- **Free Memory**: 3.4 GB
- **Swap Usage**: 0 MB used of 512 MB available
- **OOM Killer Activity**: NONE detected in kernel logs

**Node.js Process Memory**:
- Virtual Memory Size: 11.0 GB (mostly mapped, not resident)
- Resident Set Size: 75.9 MB (actual physical memory)
- Memory Usage: 0.9% of total system memory
- Peak Memory: 11.0 GB (virtual mapping)

#### 2. CPU Analysis
- **Load Average**: 1.85, 1.05, 0.75 (4-core system)
- **CPU Usage**: Low to moderate (47-77% idle)
- **Node.js CPU Usage**: 0.4% (minimal)
- **No CPU pressure detected**

#### 3. Disk Space
- **Root Filesystem**: 201 GB available (90% free)
- **Boot Partition**: 441 MB available (86% free)
- **Inode Usage**: 4% used (14.9M available)
- **No disk space constraints**

#### 4. System Limits
- **User Processes**: 29,166 allowed
- **File Descriptors**: 65,535 per process
- **Max PID**: 4,194,304
- **Node.js Open Files**: 38 (well below limit)

#### 5. Process-Specific Analysis
- **PID**: 568938
- **Parent PID**: 1 (systemd)
- **Uptime**: 15:59 (stable)
- **Threads**: 11
- **State**: Running normally

### Key Findings

1. **Memory**: System has 6 GB available memory with no swap usage
2. **CPU**: Load is normal for a 4-core system, no overload
3. **Disk**: Ample space available on all partitions
4. **Limits**: No system limits being approached
5. **OOM Killer**: No evidence of out-of-memory kills

### Conclusion

Resource exhaustion is **NOT** the cause of SIGTERM signals. The system has:
- 78% available memory
- Minimal CPU usage by Node.js
- 90% free disk space
- Well below all system limits

The SIGTERM signals must be coming from:
1. External process management (systemd, Docker, etc.)
2. Manual intervention
3. Application-level shutdown triggers
4. Parent process termination

### Recommendations

Since resources are not constrained:
1. Focus investigation on process management systems
2. Check for systemd service restart policies
3. Investigate parent process lifecycle
4. Look for application-level shutdown triggers
5. Review any monitoring/watchdog systems that might restart services
